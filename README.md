# Kinect Photos
Kinect Photos is a photo gallery browsing app built for Windows 7, 8, 10 & 11 using WPF, a .NET UI framework. It uses  SQLite to manage different users, photo albums, and file locations. Kinect Photos is currently *under early development*.

## Features
- Hands-free browsing using Kinect gestures
- Large display support
- Multi-user support with individual profiles
- Organized photo gallery display
- Zoom and view individual images


## Installation
To install Kinect Photos, you need to install the [Kinect for Windows SDK 1.8](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40278) first. Upon release, you can download the .exe from the *Releases* tab.
